If you'd like the official account of my life so far, here is my resume in [pdf](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Resume.pdf) and [word doc](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Resume.docx) flavors. And heck, I'll even throw in an [unofficial transcript](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Transcript.pdf). Some time soon I'll write up a post with a more formal treatment of my past research.

I was born and raised in West Hartford, Connecticut (I have about 10 West Hartford Pee Wee Soccer
participation trophies from my childhood, and if you hire me you can hold them). After many years of intense study, I learned how to tie my shoes and graduated from [here](https://morley.whps.org/) then [here](https://kingphilip.whps.org/) then [here](https://hall.whps.org/). 

I attended to the Univesity of Connecticut as a Molecular and Cellular Biology major. While in school, I worked for in molecular biology wet labs (at Uconn, Uconn Health, and the National Institutes of Health), designing experiments, analyzing data, and occassionally shouting eureaka. I got hooked on Bioinformatics my junior year of college, and spent many fun and frustrating hours mucking around big piles of tumor genomics data (usually with python or R). 

In may 2019, I graduated *summa cum laude* from uconn with a B.S. in molecular and cellular biology, and minors in both computer science and bioinformatics. These days, when I'm not job searching, I'm not job searching, I am possibly: 

* Googling an error message 
* writing
* Helping to take care of a flock of 7 chickens, a chihuahua, and a one eyed puggle 
  
I forsee this site as being a repository of data science/bioinformatics themed rants. I hope to make it irreverant enough for the casual reader, and scientific enough for the people led here from my resume. We'll see how that goes.

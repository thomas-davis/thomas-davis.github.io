If you'd like the formal account of my life thusfar, here is my resume in [pdf](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Resume.pdf) and [word doc](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Resume.docx) flavors. I'll even throw in an [unofficial transcript](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Transcript.pdf). Some time soon I'll write up a post with a formal treatment of my past research, which I'll link here.

I was born and raised in West Hartford, Connecticut (I have about 10 West Hartford Pee Wee Soccer
participation trophies from my childhood-- if you hire me you can hold them). After many years of study, I learned how to tie my shoes and graduated from [here](https://morley.whps.org/), then [here](https://kingphilip.whps.org/), then [here](https://hall.whps.org/). 

I attended to the Univesity of Connecticut as a Molecular and Cellular Biology major. While in school, I worked for 2 years in molecular biology wet labs (at Uconn, and the National Institutes of Health), designing experiments, analyzing data, and occassionally shouting "eureaka". I got hooked on Bioinformatics my junior year of college, and spent many fun and frustrating hours mucking around big piles of tumor genomics data (usually with python or R). 

In may 2019, I graduated summa cum laude from Uconn with a B.S. in molecular and cellular biology, and minors in both computer science and bioinformatics. These days, when I'm not job searching, I am possibly: 

* Googling an error message 
* writing
* Helping to take care of a flock of 7 chickens, a chihuahua, and a one eyed puggle

If you'd like the official account of my life so far, here is my resume in [pdf](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Resume.pdf) and [word doc](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Resume.docx) flavors. And heck, I'll even throw in an [unofficial transcript](/assets/Thomas_Davis_Transcript.pdf) cause I like the look of you. 

I was born and raised in West Hartford, Connecticut (and have the soccer participation trophies to prove it). I went to the Univesity of Connecticut as a Molecular and Cellular Biology major, and spent a good while working in molecular biology labs at UConn Health, then Uconn, and then the National Institutes of Health. I got hooked on Bioinformatics my junior year of college, joined Dr. Sheida Nabavi's lab, and now I can be found mucking around big piles of tumor genomics data (usually using python or R). 

when I'm not doing any of the above, I am possibly: 

* Googling an error message 
* writing
* Helping to take care of a flock of 7 chickens, a chihuahua, and a one eyed puggle. 
* Attempting and failing to find a way to make kale less disgusting (shoot me a recipe, please). 
  
I forsee this site as being a repository of data science/bioinformatics themed rants. I hope to make it irreverant enough for the casual reader, and scientific enough for the people led here from my resume. We'll see how that goes.       

you can read some rave reviews of me [here]
